In this project, I had the privilege of working on Papollo Hospital Dataset and Leads Analysis, utilizing data. 
This analysis aimed to offer actionable insights on patient care, billing, bed occupancy, doctor feedback, diagnosis trends, test usage, and health insurance coverage.

üîç Understanding Business Problems:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Patient Info by Patient ID: By leveraging Power BI, I meticulously organized patient data, facilitating the quick and efficient 
retrieval of patient information using unique IDs.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Billing Information: I extracted valuable billing details, offering insights into total charges, payment methods, and health 
insurance coverage for each patient.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Bed Occupancy Breakdown: Analyzing bed occupancy data allowed me to visualize the patient distribution across various wards 
(Private Rooms, General Ward, ICU), supporting resource allocation and capacity management.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Overall Feedback given to Doctors: By utilizing patient feedback data, I assessed doctor performance and patient satisfaction, 
pinpointing areas for improvement and recognition.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Diagnosis-wise Patient Count Stats:Through an extensive analysis of patient diagnoses, I identified prevalent conditions and trends 
over time, providing insights to medical staff and aiding in resource allocation.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Health Insurance Amount vs Billing Amount Stats:Through comparative analysis, I investigated the correlation between health insurance coverage 
and total billing amounts across various diagnoses, assisting in financial planning and reimbursement strategies.

üí° Key Insights:

‚úÖ Private Rooms show the highest occupancy, trailed by the General Ward and ICU, revealing the hospital's accommodation preferences and demand trends.

‚úÖ Doctor Feedback: Patients consistently provided high ratings for doctors, averaging 4 out of 5. Notably, Dr. Ravi D received the fewest feedback among 
all doctors, indicating areas for potential improvement or recognition.

‚úÖ Diagnosis Trends: Viral Infections surfaced as the predominant diagnosis, whereas Fractures exhibited the lowest patient count. This observation influences 
resource allocation and staffing determinations.

‚úÖ Test Utilization: Blood Tests were the most commonly performed, followed by CT Scans and MRI. X-ray tests were conducted less frequently, suggesting their selective 
use in diagnosis and treatment.

‚úÖ Financial Insights: Viral Infections accounted for the highest billing and health insurance expenses compared to other diagnoses, underscoring their substantial influence
on healthcare costs and resource allocation.

 Transformation, and visualization using Excel and Power BI, I equipped Apollo Hospital with actionable insights aimed at improving patient care, optimizing resource 
 allocation, and enhancing financial efficiency.
